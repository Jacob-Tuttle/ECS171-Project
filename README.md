# ECS171-Project
Machine learning project for ECS-171
<!-- ## TODO
- Front-end (done)
- Create multinomial logistic regression model (done)
- Evaluate model via confusion matrix (done)

## Roadmap
- Describing the problem scientifically  
- Background study (literature review or related work)  
- Dataset Understanding and Exploratory Data Analysis (done)
        - Heatmap correlation + pairplot
- Developing Accurate Prediction Model(s)
        - multinomial logistic regression + something else if enough time
- Evaluation of the model(s) and Testing the performance
        - confusion matrix
- Developing a basic web-based front-end to invoke and run the model(s) on input data and display the prediction output  

## Report style
- https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html  
- Include visualizations, tables, and plots in your report to show trends and report the performance and training of the model.
- Figures need to have explanatory captions that explain the trend in them.
- Plots should also be used during exploratory data analysis. (here is a guide: https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-exploratory-data-analysis-f11d843b8184 )  
- Reference figures properly in the report.  
- Related work (or background or literature review) section: review related published papers with methodology which may help or inspire your research project. For instance, the dataset they used, or the selection of techniques they studied. You need to indicate how your work is different from these past works.  
- Include your findings in the conclusion section.     
- About 5 pages of text and at least 4-5 figures in position or at the end of the document
        - The Github link to the source code of your project should be included in your final report.   
        - One page to describe the project roadmap including project milestones should be included in the report. -->
## Website: https://ecs171-project.streamlit.app/

## To run website demo locally
- From the repository directory, open a terminal and run ```streamlit run .\website\home-page.py```
- Run ```pip install streamlit``` if you don't already have streamlit
